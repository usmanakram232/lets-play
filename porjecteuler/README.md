## Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution

``` java
  System.out.println(
    IntStream.range(1, 1000).filter(num -> num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0).sum()
  );
  
```

*Result* 233168

## Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

```java
  @DisplayName("Problem 2: sum of even numbers in fibonacci sequence, under 4 million = ")
  @Test
  void testSolution1() {
    long[] fib = new long[]{1, 2};
    long sumEven = 2;
    while (fib[1] <= 4000000) {
      long tmp = fib[0] + fib[1];
      fib[0] = fib[1];
      fib[1] = tmp;
      if (tmp % 2 == 0) {
        sumEven += tmp;
      }
    }
    System.out.println(sumEven);
  }
```

*Result*: 

## Problem 3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
